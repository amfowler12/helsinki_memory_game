This is a memory card matching game inspired by the city of Helsinki. The start page has some city line art that I designed to introduce the game. When you click start, you are taken to the levels page that has easy, medium, and hard modes. Selecting a level takes you to the game.

The levels are differentiated by the number of cards and the time. The easiest mode only has 8 cards, or 4 pairs, to memorize. You have 60 seconds to complete the game, or you lose. Medium mode has 12 cards (6 pairs) and 90 seconds. Hard mode has 14 cards (7 pairs) and 150 seconds. Once a level is completed, a check mark will appear on the title. You can click the refresh icon in the corner to reset your progress and start over.

The game itself uses either images that I took from my phone while exploring the city or stock photos. Tapping the card makes it flip over, and once you have a match, it stays flipped over. The top has the time countdown and shows the score so far. The score is calculated by giving 100 points for each pair, and subtracting -10 points for each mismatch. 

Finally, the result screen appears after the countdown is done. You will get a "Time's up" message with a red icon if you fail to complete the game, or a "You Won" message with a green trophy icon if you win. You will also see the score breakdown below so you can understand how you played. There are two buttons below, prompting you to either play again or return back to levels.

The Helsinki Memory game introduces you to the city in a fun and memorable way. Try your best to beat all the levels and become a master of the city!

NOTE: The card images take a while to load so please wait a bit and then it will work!
